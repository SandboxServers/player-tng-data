description: End-of-day memory rewrite. Use after `sleep` returns the day digest.
---
Use the day digest from `sleep` and `memory/journal/current.md`. The day number NNN comes from the digest.

1. Write `memory/journal/day-NNN.md`: one paragraph on what mattered today.
2. Update `memory/people/<name>.md` for each person you dealt with: your impression, trust from 0 to 100, and why.
3. Update `memory/beliefs.md`: add what you learned, and strike out what proved false. If you died today, write first what killed you, what you dropped and where, and what it taught you. Copy the place and the things as the world gave them: the death line may name where in the world you died, and the drop line names what you dropped and roughly where, with coordinates when the world gives them. Note that things may be gone by the time you return, and that going back is worth it only if the danger that killed you is worth it.
4. Rewrite `memory/goals.md`: ranked, with reasons. Drop what no longer matters.
5. Write what new thing you learned today, what you are curious about next, and who you could tell. Keep it in `memory/beliefs.md` and `memory/goals.md`.
6. Rewrite `memory/summary.md` so it fits on one page, under 60 lines.
7. Empty `memory/journal/current.md` back to its heading, `# Journal`.
8. Call `commit_memory` with `day NNN: <six words>`.
9. Say a short goodnight to yourself, then stop. A new day begins when you wake.
